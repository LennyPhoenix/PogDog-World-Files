# PogDog World Files Archive - 01/06/2021

This is an archive of the PogDog server world files.
All sensitive information has been removed from the archive, including player data, chat logs and plugin data.

There are two folders, one for the survival server, and one for the creative server.

## How to Play

- Make sure you have [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) installed.
- Open the world folder you want to play.
- Run either `start.cmd` (Windows) or `start.sh` (Linux/MacOS).
- Open Minecraft, and connect to the server:
  - Survival: `localhost:25565`
  - Creative: `localhost:25665`
  
## Converting to Singleplayer

- Download the world you want to play.
- Copy the `world_nether/DIM-1` folder into the `world/` folder (as `DIM-1`).
- Do the same with the `world_the_end/DIM1` folder, naming it `DIM1/`.
- Copy the `world/` folder into your Minecraft worlds folder, renaming it to something recognisable (e.g. "PogDog Survival").
  - The Minecraft worlds folder will be located at either:
    - Windows: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\`
    - Or Linux: `~/.minecraft/saves/`
- Load the world up and enjoy!
